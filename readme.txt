1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can This Be Used With The Legacy Google Analytics Code? =
No, this plugin is for Google Universal Analytics.  You can upgrade any old non-Universal property to support both legacy and Universal under your [Google Analytics Property Settings](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?#management/Settings/).

= Can You Add [insert feature here]? =
If it's possible and it makes sense, then yes.  The best way to put in a request would be to create a thread in the [support forum over here](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/forums/better-analytics.31/).

= I speak a language that isn't supported by this plugin, can I help translate it? =
Yes.  Unfortunately we don't speak every language in the world, so if you would like to contribute a translation, please contact us in the [support forum over here](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/forums/better-analytics.31/).
